# **Newspaper Summarizer**

This project originated as a midterm assignment in the [PMT](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/fis/karton_predmeta/13E033PMT-2013) course.

The application enables users to summarize newspaper articles. It is built upon natural language processing utilizing the [newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) library, while the tkinter library was employed for the graphical user interface.

### **Overview and Features of the Application**

In essence, the application allows users to summarize news articles by entering a URL and clicking the "Obradi" button. It provides a comprehensive display of relevant information. Moreover, it offers the capability of filtering unwanted articles, which is based on the words that can be entered separated by commas after the user has checked the corresponding checkbox. The application also supports processing multiple articles by enabling users to retrieve a news feed from a designated webpage, creating a list of articles that can be conveniently navigated using the "Prethodni" and "SledeÄ‡i" buttons.

Please note that the documentation, which provides a detailed explanation of the application's functionality, is exclusively available in the Serbian language.

When running the program for the first time, it is necessary to uncomment the first line of the main function in the main.py file, after which you can comment it out again.
